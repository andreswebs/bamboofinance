# Financing Ecologically Responsible Bamboo-Wood Production in Brazil With Ethereum Smart-Contracts

(Andre Silva - August, 2018)

## Introduction

Background: there is a federal law in Brazil that establishes a national policy of incentive for bamboo cultivation and use. The law is from 2011, but it has never been regulated (i.e. practically implemented).

Bamboo is a thousand-uses material that has great potential for income generation and sustainability, but there is not an established internal market nor production chain.

There are some isolated initiatives to foster production in the country, and independent work done by a few remarkable individuals.

The idea is to use private micro-finance contracts (credit money) to enable production by small farmers and cooperatives. 

The cost of production is relatively low. To plant one hectare (10.000 m2) one needs around $ 4,200.00 BRL or $ 1,146.51 EUR. (1 Brazilian Real [BRL] = 0.27 Euro [EUR], as of August 2018)

One hectare of adult (after 4-6 years) giant bamboo (genus _Dendrocalamus_ or _Guadua_) yields around 1400 culms per year.

The material may be sold for around $ 10.00 BRL per linear meter. Adult giant bamboo culms reach around 15-30 meters. So there's a good potential return of investment for farmers. 

The contract works like this: 

Someone finances any amount to a farmer, and gets his/her money back after 7 years (84 months) with a 12% annual interest rate. After any amount of time the person may sell this contract to someone else to get her money back at the same rate, anytime. This is backed by a regular financial partnership contract in which an individual or organization lends money to a farmer or coop to plant bamboo.

This financial contract originates a token that is backed by bamboo, and whose value increases at a rate of 12% / year. The token has high potential liquidity, being convertible to legal tender currency at any time. Investors who buy the tokens are financing sustainable bamboo production.
